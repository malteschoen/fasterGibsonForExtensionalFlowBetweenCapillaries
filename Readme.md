# fasterGibsonForExtensionalFlowBetweenCapillaries

## What is this?

This repository is supposed to hold information

1. on the relations between elongational/extensional viscosity AND flow rate AND elongational/extensional pressure drop
2. on the formulae developed by Gibson in the late eighties to depict these relations
3. on our newer formula that gives up some accuracy to have better 

and also materials for other researchers to reproduce our findings and improve on them.

## How can I use this?

## The theory behind it

## What else should I know about?
